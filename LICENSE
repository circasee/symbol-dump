Custom License for symbol-dump — Version 1.0.0

© 2025 circasee (https://github.com/circasee). All rights reserved.
This work is licensed under a custom license.
Redistribution and use are permitted only under the terms described below.

Last updated: 2025-08-05  
License version: 1.0.0  
License subject to future revocation or reissuance.  
Future versions of this license may supersede this one.  
Use of this work constitutes acceptance of the terms below.

---

Permitted

- Personal or educational use, including:
  - Reading, experimentation, and adaptation for individual learning
  - Referencing concepts in academic or non-commercial training (with attribution; see below)

- Use in paid training or courses only with prior permission, attribution, and where possible, royalties or licensing fees

- Rehosting for archival purposes with visible attribution and without commercial intent

“Visible attribution” means prominently displayed credit, legible to end users, and not buried in metadata, footnotes, or non-rendered content.

Use in free or public training offered by commercial or sponsored entities still requires prior permission.

This includes conference talks, webinars, or workshops labeled “free” but used to promote a service, product, or brand — even indirectly.

Broadly available, community-first events (e.g. DEFCON, WWWHackin’ Fest with its Pay-What-You-Want structure) are generally fine. High-barrier events (e.g. gated enterprise trainings, Black Hat Arsenals, invite-only webinars) may require case-by-case review.

Not Permitted Without Explicit License

- Integration into commercial training, internal knowledge bases, or monetized platforms
- Repurposing or paraphrasing techniques as original work
- Claiming novelty based on minor reordering or phrasing changes
- Closed redistribution without visible credit
- Use in any AI model training or LLM corpus without prior approval, including prompt tuning, fine-tuning, embedding, vectorization, or ingestion into retrieval systems, regardless of whether model outputs directly reproduce the source
- Rehosting behind paywalls, inside private wikis, or on access-controlled systems unless clearly for individual, non-commercial use
- Bundling or packaging content into tools, libraries, automations, or plugins for distribution or resale
- Use in academic materials (e.g. lectures, papers, slide decks) without visible attribution
- Symbolic attribution (e.g. buried links or minimal references) while ignoring core license terms

Derivative works based on this material must comply with these terms unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Any violation of these terms immediately revokes all granted rights, retroactive to the point of first non-compliant use.

Attribution

If you build on the work, credit it.

Minor edits to structure, phrasing, or code do not constitute originality.

If you found this material helpful and publish something as a result — even tangentially — cite it or link to the repo.

A link alone does not imply compliance. Compliance means following the terms.

---

Attribution TLDR (which is, ironically, longer than the attribution section)

If this project shaped your thinking, saved you time, or influenced what you built — credit the work.

You don’t need a whole attribution talk (I gave one — and I even mispronounced half the names).  
It’s not about being flawless. It’s about being sincere.

Don’t drop a link and call it good. Don’t skip a slide because you ran long.

Say what the work gave you. Show others where it came from. Be specific. Be real.

Good attribution means:
- Mentioning the project by name
- Linking to the repo where people can find it
- Calling out what you took or learned — structure, idea, phrasing, technique, etc.
- Doing it where people will actually see it (README, slide, blog, paper, etc.)

Not sure what’s enough?  
Open a GitHub issue labeled `request-for-contact` and ask.

Do not attempt indirect or scraped contact.

Final Notes

This license is designed to:
- Respect quiet contributors  
- Deter technicality pirates  
- Preserve author intent

Do the right thing, even when it’s technically optional.

This license shall be governed by the laws of the United States and enforced under the appropriate jurisdiction of the author.

Backdated Commits

Some commits in this project may be backdated using `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` to reflect the original creation time.  
The `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` represents the date of publication and governs when the license terms take effect.  
Use of any content is subject to the license terms from the committer date forward, regardless of authoring date.
